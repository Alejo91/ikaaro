ikaaro 0.76.0 - 2017/01/18
==================================

Now itools/ikaaro can be installed via pip:

    $ virtualenv --python python2 --system-site-packages 076
    $ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/bepatient-fr/itools.git@0.76#egg=itools
    $ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/bepatient-fr/ikararo.git@0.76#egg=ikaaro

The setup.py file has changed:

    # Import from itools
    from itools.core import get_abspath
    from itools.pkg import setup
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        path = get_abspath('./')
        setup(path)

Here the list of changes:

  - We add UUID_Field to all resources (unique id for all resources)
  - We've removed the rdv reminders cron in ikaaro.calendar
  - We've update requirements.txt
  - Now cron-interval value is used (cron interval is not 1 anymore - so check your config.conf)
  - ctime/mtime/last_author are initialized on all resources at creation
  - There's a new method change_class_id() to simplify code migration:

        user.change_class_id('doctor')

  - config.conf allow to configure if we accept cors

        accept-cors = 1

  - get_value_title can take a new attribute 'mode'.
    For example you'will be able to do:

        user.get_value_title('ctime', mode='details')
        user.get_value_title('ctime', mode='ago')

  - Allow to set user in "context.search" method so we can simulate access for others users
  - We've replaced "_" by "-" in table head css classes
  - We've added a /;update_instance to launch update methods from the website
  - Commits: Fix bug if email of author is None
  - Root: "make_user" check if user already exists and return None if it's the case
