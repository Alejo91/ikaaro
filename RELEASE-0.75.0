Changes
-------

This major release is labeled as beta because the upgrade logic is not
yet available, we will drop the "beta" label when this is done.

Two major features have been dropped in this release: websites and the
tracker module. They may, eventually, come back in a different form.

System admin:
- There is a new configuration option, 'log-email'. If set an email will be
  sent to the given email address whenever an internal server error (500)
  happens.

Performance:
- Now the static files at '/ui/' are served using specific logic, and much
  faster than before.
- Now access control is defined by a query to the database, this fixes
  long-standing bug #535, smooth and fast.

Major features:
- There is a new configuration system, located at '/config/', where
  configuration modules are stored. And comes with many small improvements.
- There is a new access-control system, which can be configured through the
  back-office at '/config/access'. It is based on user groups instead of
  roles (a user may belong to several groups), ownership (some resources
  have an owner), and access rules.
- It is now possible to define new resource types from the back-office, at
  '/config/models'. This feature is exposed by the new Agenda module (see
  below), so it is possible to define events with custom fields.

Minor features:
- The registration form is back, it includes a captcha, and can be configured
  through '/config/register'.
- Users are not folders anymore, but they have an avatar. Users can not be
  removed but deactivated from the back-office.

Modules:
- The Calendar module has been renamed to Agenda and has been much improved:
  support for recurrence rules, reminders, better user interface, now events
  are attached to calendars (ala Google), etc.
- The Blog: automatically add posts in a YYYY/MM layout (XXX)

Pogramming Interface:
- Resource.class_schema has been replaced by fields. It is easier to override
  fields defined by a parent class, and they are used by autoadd/autoedit
  (see below) to automatize views.
- Files are now fields, this allows a resource to have several files
  attached to it (for instance: user.avatar, user.cv.en, etc.)
- New AutoAdd/AutoEdit views replace NewInstance/DBResource_Edit. They make
  much easier to write automatic add/edit views for resources.
- The autoform has a richer namespace, this allows to easily define custom
  templates.
- New search field 'base_classes' allows to search the database for resources
  which have some parent class.  This replaces 'is_folder', 'is_image' etc.
- There is the beginnings of a template system for emails.
- Table resources have been removed. Now everything should be a resource.
- Now comments are resources on their own.
- The 'OrderedFolder' class allows to order items in a folder.
