ikaaro 0.61.3 (2010/05/XX)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

Now the configuration file requires the listen-address and listen-port
variables to be set.  It is possible again to listen to any interface,
to do so the listen-address variable must be set to the "*" value.

The locale files have been updated and slimmed.

The code has been optimized a little, now ui handlers are cached.
