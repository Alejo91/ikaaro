ikaaro 0.20.0 (2007/12/27)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document mangement (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This is the first release of ikaaro as a separate package (before it
was distributed as a sub-package of the "itools" [1] library).

From a functional and visual point of view, the changes of this release
are modest:

 - Now we have a friendlier user interface to manage multilingual web
   pages.

 - Following the W3C recommendations [2], type extensions have been
   drop from the URI, so for example "http://.../document.pdf" becomes
   "http://.../document".

However, the most important changes
