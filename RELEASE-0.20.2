ikaaro 0.20.2 (2008/01/XX)
==========================

This is a Content Management System built on Python & itools, among
other features ikaaro provides:

 - content and document management (index&search, metadata, etc.)
 - multilingual user interfaces and content
 - high level modules: wiki, forum, tracker, etc.

This release brings a few new features.

The new events log (log/events) keeps information about the database
activity.  The debug log has been removed, and now debugging data is
recorded in the events log.

The tracker has a new field named "CC", so any user in the "CC" list
will be notified with an email every time the issue changes.

Every file object has a new view named "backlinks", which shows the
list of objects that reference this file.

Many bugs have been fixed, including #108, #205, #207, #215, #222, #224,
#225, #227, #228, #230 and #231.
